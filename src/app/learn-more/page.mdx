# What Problems does Homies™ Solve?

## Lack of Visibility into Tenant’s Rental History

Landlords often face significant challenges in gaining a clear view of a tenant's rental history. This is primarily because the only available information comes through word of mouth and personal references, which can be unreliable and incomplete.

## No Visibility into Landlord’s Diligence

On the flip side, tenants have no means to assess a landlord's reliability and diligence. There are no established systems for landlord references, leaving tenants to make decisions with little information about the landlord's reputation or management practices.

## Asynchronous Listings

Rental listings are inherently asynchronous, meaning that prospective tenants frequently find themselves viewing properties that are already pending other offers. This misalignment creates frustration and inefficiency in the rental search process.

## Misrepresentation of Listings

Another significant issue in the rental market is the frequent misrepresentation or inaccuracy of listings. Rental platforms often feature listings that do not accurately reflect the properties, leading to wasted time and effort for prospective tenants.

## Manual and Error-Prone Processes

The entire rental process remains largely manual, expensive, and prone to errors. It heavily relies on the integrity and good faith of both landlords and tenants, which can result in complications and disputes.

## Inefficient Communication

Communication between renters and landlords is typically ad-hoc and lacks a structured system for auditing or taking action. Landlords often resort to sharing their contact information on public platforms like Facebook Marketplace or Kijiji, which poses safety risks.

## Tedious KYC Process for Landlords

The Know Your Customer (KYC) process for landlords is often time-consuming, repetitive, and costly. Many landlords are compelled to develop their own solutions to streamline this process, adding to their administrative burdens.

## Lack of Tracking for Listing History

There is no reliable system to track the history of rental listings, including upgrades, renovations, price changes, or significant events like floods. This lack of historical data makes it difficult for both landlords and tenants to make informed decisions.

## Challenges in Payment Collection

Collecting rent payments can be a challenging aspect of property management. The lack of streamlined and reliable payment systems adds another layer of difficulty for landlords, potentially leading to delayed or missed payments.
